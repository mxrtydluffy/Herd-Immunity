1.) What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

The inputs I made were:
    Population Size: 13,500
    Vaccination Percentage: .30
    Virus Name: Polio
    Mortality Rate: 0.77
    Reproductive Rate: 0.43
    Initial Infected:  10

2.) What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

- Around 85% of the population became infected before the virus burned out.


3.) What percentage of the population died from the virus?

- 40% of the population died from the virus


4.) Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

- A vaccination saved someone 82% of the population. This was calculated by getting the vaccinapted population and subtraing that from the intial total amount
since it comprises of those who didn't get the vaccination. In the end, it saved over 3/4 of the population.
